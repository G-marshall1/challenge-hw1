# Horiseon Marketing

## Description

- I love new challenges and decided marketing would be a great first project.
- I chose a marketing website because of the unique challenges that they naturally pose.
- I desided to create a webpage that would use all semantic elements to try and match todays accessibility standards
- I learned that not all elements need to be semantic but being able to create a accessible plat form allows those who may have challenges reading will have a better understanding of my page.
